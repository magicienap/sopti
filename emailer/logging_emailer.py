Emailer.py is a program to send emails from a database of notification 
requests.
It is part of the SOPTI (School Schedule Optimizer) package written 
by Pierre-Marc Fournier <pmf@users.sf.net>
For more information about emailer.py see the emailer.py file.

This module adds two custom log levels to the logging module and 
wraps the other functions so it can be used like this:
import logging_emailer as logging
