# public keys and ssh agent if you want to automate it)
# To do this, supply a first argument in the form of [user@]hostname

# If you don't have access to a unix machine at polymtl.ca but are a 
# student there you can register for an account on the STEP 
# (http://step.polymtl.ca). Alternatively, you can try using the VPN.
